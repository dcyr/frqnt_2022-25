This folder contains simulation packages, i.e. individual folders that contain all files necessary to run simulation.
Folders can be copied anywhere on your system.

Individual simulations can be run using the "landis-ii-7.cmd scenario.txt" from the associated folder, or alternatively, batch of simulations can be run using the "Rscript.exe simPilot.R" command from the parent folder.
The simPilot.R script, which allows to run multiple simulations in parallel, requires some R packages to be installed. Make sure that your computer has enough resources to run multiple simulations in parallel.

Those simulation packages have been tested and should work with the appropriate extensions installed (versions are indicated in the README.txt file contained in each zip file.)
