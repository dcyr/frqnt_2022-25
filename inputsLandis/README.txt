This folder contains all input files required to run LANDIS-II / ForCS simulations.
Several versions are usually available. Those can be associated with a specific study area, climate change scenario, management scenario, etc., which should be indicated by the file name.

The file name nomenclature should be self-explanatory and is designed to be human- and machine-readable. Scripts are used to assemble simulation packages.
